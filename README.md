A web browser is a software application that helps you access and view websites on the internet. Popular web browsers include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Safari. Browsers work by first taking the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from a web page and parsing them into a structure that the computer can understand. This parsed structure is then turned into a render tree that outlines how the content should look visually. The browser then calculates the positions and sizes of elements through a process called layout or reflow. Finally, the browser paints the elements onto the screen, filling them with colors and images. This whole process allows us to see and interact with web pages.

Hereâ€™s a basic rundown of how a web browser works:

- **User Input**:
  - You type a web address (URL) into the browser's address bar or click on a link. For example, typing www.google.com or clicking on a link to visit a page.

- **DNS Lookup**:
  - The browser needs to find the IP address of the website you want to visit. It does this through a process called DNS (Domain Name System) lookup. Think of DNS as the internet's phone book that matches web addresses to their corresponding IP addresses.

- **Sending a Request**:
  - Once the browser knows the IP address, it sends a request to the web server at that IP address asking for the website's content. This request is usually sent using a protocol called HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) or its secure version, HTTPS.

- **Server Response**:
  - The web server receives the request and processes it. It then sends back the requested web page, which is typically made up of HTML (HyperText Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript files.

- **Rendering the Page**:
  - The browser takes the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files it received and starts to render the page. Rendering means the browser translates these files into the visual representation you see on your screen.
    - **HTML**: Defines the structure and content of the web page (e.g., headings, paragraphs, images).
    - **CSS**: Styles the web page (e.g., colors, fonts, layout).
    - **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity to the web page (e.g., animations, forms, dynamic content).

- **Displaying the Content**:
  - The browser displays the web page on your screen. It might also load additional resources like images, videos, and other media. These resources might be loaded simultaneously or as you scroll down the page.

- **Interactivity**:
  - You can now interact with the web page. Clicking buttons, entering information into forms, and playing videos are examples of interactions handled by the browser through JavaScript.

**Browser Components**

A browser consists of several key components:

- **User Interface (UI)**: The visual elements you see but can't manipulate, like the address bar and settings.
- **Browser Engine**: Acts as a mediator between the UI and the rendering engine.
- **Rendering Engine**: Parses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display web pages.
- **Networking**: Handles HTTP and HTTPS requests to load resources.
- **JavaScript Interpreter**: Interprets JavaScript code.
- **UI Backend**: Used for drawing basic widgets.
- **Data Persistence**: Manages storage options like cookies and local storage.

**Rendering Engine Workflow**

When you open a website, the rendering engine goes through several steps:

- **Parsing**: Translates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a structure code can use.
- **Render Tree Construction**: Builds a tree of visual elements based on the parsed content.
- **Layout**: Calculates the position and size of each element.
- **Painting**: Fills the elements with color and renders the final visual output.

**Parsing Explained**

Parsing involves breaking down a document into a format that code can process, using:

- **Lexical Analysis (Lexer)**: Converts text into tokens, the smallest units.
- **Syntax Analysis (Parser)**: Applies grammar rules to organize tokens into a structure.

**HTML Parsing**

HTML requires unconventional parsers because it needs to handle errors and automatically correct them, ensuring that even flawed HTML can render properly. This process is guided by rules set by the HTML document type definition.

**Render Tree and Layout**

- **Render Tree**: Created alongside the DOM tree, representing visual elements.
- **Layout (or Reflow in Mozilla)**: Determines the position and size of elements, often using a "dirty bit" system to optimize re-rendering.

**Painting**

The final step is painting, which involves:

- Applying colors and images to the render tree elements.
- Using global and incremental painting methods to optimize performance.
